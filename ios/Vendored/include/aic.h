 *
 * **How sample rate affects enhancement:**
 *
 * - Models trained at lower sample rates (e.g., 8 kHz) can only enhance frequencies
 *   up to their Nyquist limit (4 kHz for 8 kHz models)
 * - When processing higher sample rate input (e.g., 48 kHz) with a lower-rate model,
 *   only the lower frequency components will be enhanced
 *
 * **Enhancement blending:**
 *
 * When enhancement strength is set below 1.0, the enhanced signal is blended with
 * the original, maintaining the full frequency spectrum of your input while adding
 * the model's noise reduction capabilities to the lower frequencies.
 *
 * **Sample rate and optimal frames relationship:**
 *
 * When using different sample rates than the model's native rate, the optimal number
 * of frames (returned by `aic_model_get_optimal_num_frames`) will change. The processor's output
 * delay remains constant regardless of sample rate as long as you use the optimal frame
 * count for that rate.
 *
 * **Recommendation:**
 *
 * For maximum enhancement quality across the full frequency spectrum, match your
 * input sample rate to the model's native rate when possible.
 *
 * # Parameters

 * - For a dedicated VAD model, the audio buffer is input-only and passes through unchanged.
 *   This delay is the VAD prediction latency: how many samples a speech decision from

 *   Use this value to line up VAD decisions with the input timeline.
 *
 * **Delay behavior:**
 * - **Before initialization:** Returns the base processing delay using the processor's
 *   optimal frame size at its native sample rate
 * - **After initialization:** Returns the actual delay for your specific configuration,
 *   including any additional buffering introduced by non-optimal frame sizes
 *
 * **Important:** The delay value is always expressed in samples at the sample rate
 * you configured during `aic_processor_initialize`. To convert to time units:
 * `delay_ms = (delay_samples * 1000) / sample_rate`
 *
 * **Note:** Using frame sizes different from the optimal value returned by
 * `aic_model_get_optimal_num_frames` will increase the delay beyond the processor's base latency.

 * - `context`: Processor context instance. Must not be NULL.

/**
 * Replaces the bearer token on a running analyzer.
 *
 * Use this when your license key is a JWT and needs to be refreshed
 * before it expires. Calling this with a renewed token lets you stay authenticated
 * without tearing down and recreating the analyzer: the analyzer handle stays valid,
 * buffered spectra stay available, and the new token is used for all
 * subsequent authentication against the ai-coustics backend.
 *
 * In-place updates are only supported when both the originally configured key and
 * the new token are JWTs. Other license types cannot be swapped in this way.
 *
 * On any error the call is a no-op: the previously active token remains in use and
 * the telemetry session is unaffected (no backoff, no interruption to processing).
 *
 * On success the swap is applied immediately and is **not** gated on backend
 * acceptance. The token is validated locally for format only; if the backend later
 * rejects it (e.g. expired or revoked), the SDK retries it under backoff rather than
 * rolling back to the prior token, and analysis calls may be rejected if no
 * accepted token arrives in time. Supplying a known-good token via this call
 * during that window recovers the session.
 *
 * Safe to call concurrently with collector buffering. Do not call this concurrently
 * with `aic_analyzer_analyze_buffered` or `aic_analyzer_destroy` on the same handle.
 *
 * # Parameters
 * - `analyzer`: Analyzer instance. Must not be NULL.
 * - `token`: NULL-terminated string containing the new JWT. Must not be NULL.
 *
 * # Returns
 * - `AIC_ERROR_CODE_SUCCESS`: Token replaced successfully
 * - `AIC_ERROR_CODE_NULL_POINTER`: `analyzer` or `token` is NULL
 * - `AIC_ERROR_CODE_LICENSE_FORMAT_INVALID`: New token could not be parsed; the existing token stays in use
 * - `AIC_ERROR_CODE_TOKEN_UPDATE_UNSUPPORTED`: The original or new key does not support in-place updates; the existing token stays in use
 *
 * # Safety
 * - This function is not real-time safe. It locks a mutex and allocates memory.
 * - The `analyzer` pointer must have been created by `aic_analyzer_pair_create`.
 * - `token` must point to a valid null-terminated UTF-8 string.
